# Base Repo for Learning/Practicing Git Basics

This repo contains a binary counter system implemented using the NIOS II processor and DE10 boards. The system decrements or increments a counter variable whenever the pushbuttons are pressed. The counter is displayed using the LEDs on the board

# Activity Steps

1. Fork this repository.
2. Setup the NIOS II system locally.
3. Make and commit a change in both local and remote main branches
4. Create a feature branch and change the base address for the LEDS. Propagate this change in all required files
5. Make a change in main branch and push to remote. This will helps us illustrate a merge conflict
6. Go back to branch, push to remote, and initiate pull request
7. Solve merge conflict in local branch and update pull request
8. Accept/merge changes to main branch (we are skipping the code review process)
